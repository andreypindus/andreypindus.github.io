I have worked in the IT industry for around 12 years, working in DataOps, DevOps and Architecture roles with mission critical systems across a wide range of industries including financial services, telecommunications and Big Data. I'm passionate about cloud technology and know first hand how important it is to keep your skills up to date so that you can get to work on the coolest projects out there.
